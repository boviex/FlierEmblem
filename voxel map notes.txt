voxel map notes

First, get a heightmap(8bpp bitmap) and a colourmap(16bpp bitmap) (16x16 for now?)

tempgfx? is this to fill the screen while waiting to render?

mode5 is 128x160 and screen is 160x240 so it is scaled (125% and 150% but how does that map to 0xA0 (0.625 or 1/1.6 should be 0xAA but A8 works) and 0xBE(0.7421875 or 1/1.3473684211 should be 0xcc but c8 works))
(can we rotate 90deg and scale 187.5%? i.e. pa 0x100 and pd 0x88)

main loop:
	use memset to fill vram with sky colour? (or memcpy to use a skybox)
	Render()
	  take coords, angle, fov (assume 90?)
	  loop from min to max distance from point, incrementing by INC_STEP (i.e. for each row)
	    Get the line from left edge to right edge (use a lookup?) and stretch to screen width
	    For each column in the new line, draw a vertical line down if it is on the heightmap (stopping if it hits a drawn line?)

how do we tell what is in view and what is occluded?

Ybuffer is an array of size screenwidth and each contains the max height so far.
how do we change detail going away from screen?

for each row:
pleft = (-sin(a)-cos(a)+x, sin(a)-cos(a))+y)
pright = (cos(a)-sin(a)+x, -sin(a)-cos(a)+y)
